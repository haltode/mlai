# Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation

Implementation of some basic algorithms in machine learning.

I'm using the [Octave](https://gnu.org/software/octave/) programming language, and [Andrew Ng's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) as a means to built these algorithms.

Here are the current available algorithms :

- Linear regression (with multiple variables)
- Logistic regression (with regularization)
